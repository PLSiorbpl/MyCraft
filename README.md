## ⛓️‍💥 Build Instructions
- Get VS Code (I like just it)
- Get g++ compiler (MinGW)
- You need c++ extension too (in VS Code)
- Edit include Path (if its not detecting Include's)
- Run make.bat file and it should work
- You can also compile it with CMake but idk how
### 🔩 Recomended Include Path
- ${workspaceFolder}/**
- ${workspaceFolder}/MyCraft/Include/**
- ${workspaceFolder}/MyCraft/Include/glm/**
- ${workspaceFolder}/MyCraft/**
